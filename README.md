# Ohpen assignment üè¶üë∑

This REST API application was created to allow clients to process thier data in Ohpen infrastructure. Application was created with ASP.NET Framework and tests with XUnit. SOLID, KISS and DRY have been followed as much as possible.

## ü™∂ Features

+ Process data. Application supports **Bulk** and **Batch** jobs, API validates inputs and returns status.

+ Get logs. API is also possible to return logs with results of a processed jobs.

+ User register and login. To save time, I've simplified the logic and did not use ASP.NET.Identity.
